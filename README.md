# Sentiment Analysis using RoBERTa

This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data using the
**RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)** transformer model.
It classifies text into sentiments such as **positive, negative, or neutral**.

The project is part of my personal portfolio and demonstrates the use of
modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and transformer-based models.
